# Roadmap

Here's a brief roadmap of where I'm planning to take this project:

- Check for a clean Git state before introducing any bugs.
- Make a new commit after introducing bugs.
- Expand the variety of exception types that can be introduced.
- Expand the variety of possible causes for inducing specific exceptions.
- Generate logical (non-crashing) errors as well as specific exception types.
- Expand usage to allow an arbitrary number and kind of bugs.
    - **(implemented)** Support an arbitrary number of one kind of bug.
    - Support multiple kinds of bugs in one call.
- Develop a list of good projects to practice against. ie, clone <project> from GitHub, run its tests, run `py-bugger`, and practice debugging.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, please jump into the [issues](https://github.com/ehmatthes/py-bugger/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/ehmatthes/py-bugger/discussions).
